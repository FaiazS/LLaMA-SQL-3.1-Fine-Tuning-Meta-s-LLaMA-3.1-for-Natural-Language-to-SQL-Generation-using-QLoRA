# LLaMA-SQL-3.1-Fine-Tuning-Meta-s-LLaMA-3.1-for-Natural-Language-to-SQL-Generation-using-QLoRA


A hands-on project where I fine-tuned Metaâ€™s LLaMA 3.1 using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to enhance performance on **structured SQL reasoning tasks**. This demonstrates how LLMs can be adapted efficiently for domain-specific reasoning with minimal compute and maximum impact.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

âœ… Fine-tuned a large language model (LLaMA 3.1) on custom SQL-based prompts  

âœ… Used **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** via **LoRA** to reduce training cost  

âœ… Created an Alpaca-style SQL dataset with instructions, inputs, outputs, and explanations  

âœ… Evaluated performance before vs after fine-tuning using real-world SQL examples  

âœ… Deployed models to GPU for inference and response comparison  

âœ… Built end-to-end training and inference pipeline using Hugging Face + PyTorch
